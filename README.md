# ADF2MP3
Grand Theft Auto: Vice City .ADF to MP3 (or vice versa) converter using Python. Requires FFMPEG to convert to .WAV (PC) or .WMA (Xbox).

## Usage:
- Copy "adf2mp3.py" to the folder containing the .ADF files you'd like to convert
- Run the script & select the format you'd like to convert to (ie; ADF to MP3, MP3 to ADF, ADF to WAV, ADF to WMA, etc.)
- Wait for it to convert the files
- Profit!

## TODO:
- Add game-specific & platform-specific conversion options (ie; convert VC radio stations to GTA 3)
- Figure out how to modify .GXT files to replace radio station names automatically.
